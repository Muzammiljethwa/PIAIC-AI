-------------------------------------

Download Following Dataset and use five text(use randomly generated 5 numbers and extract the data of the generated numbers from the dataset) to test the assignments.

1) one-hot coding of the following data using book codes (naive codes) of listing 6.1.

2) Also, provide one-hot coding using Keras built-in function (listing 6.3).

3) provide one-hot coding with hashing (listing 6.4)

4) Validate the how much they are similar. Try to maximize the similarity (ideally should be 100% the same). Specify the reason if both are not the same.

5) Try to implement word-embedding using code given in listing (6.7) and shared with me the embedding array as well as the word dictionary.

6) From 6.8 code pre-trained word-embeddings

7) Apply RNN to the given text (listing 6.21) and provide output

8) Match the results of RNN (step 7) with the step 5 and also with step 6. Share the output of the analysis.
